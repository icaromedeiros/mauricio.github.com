My name is Maurício Linhares de Aragão Junior (pretty big huh?), I'm a Brazilian programmer, with some experience writting Java, Ruby and Objective-C applications, currently working for <a href="http://www.officedrop.com/">OfficeDrop</a>, a Boston based documents management solutions company. We specialize in scanning, OCR and searching documents, visit our website to know more about what we do.

I've been programming since 2003 and I've done a lot of Java and Ruby over these years, with some C#, PHP and Erlang along the way. My main interests are web application development, machine learning and concurrent programming. Right now I'm trying to get my head around ObjectiveC to start some iPhone and iPad development.
